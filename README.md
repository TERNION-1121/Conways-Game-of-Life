... is a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) devised by Mathematician John Conway.  It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, (in this project a 60 x 80 grid of square cells) each of which is in one of two possible states, live `(1)` or dead `(0)` (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time _(or simply generation)_ , the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Implementation in Python

For the game's implementation we have made use of the `pygame` and `numpy` modules.

The **`update()`** method takes an array of cells (60 x 80 in size), and returns an array of cells of the corresponding next generation, after applying the above mentioned rules.

#### `main()`

As the program begins, it is paused, i.e. by click-dragging your mouse over the square cells, you can make them alive.
As soon as `SPACEBAR` is pressed, it resumes and the generations begin to change.
